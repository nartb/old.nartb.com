						<h2>Mouth & Esophagus</h2>
					</header>
					<p>When the magical blob enters Bob's <strong>mouth</strong>, he uses his teeth to break it down into smaller pieces. This is called <strong>mechanical digestion</strong>.
						Those two orange things on each side of Bob's mouth are his <strong>salivary glands</strong>. These release <strong>salivary amylase</strong> which helps
						to break down the magical blob before it reaches his stomach. The tube that the magical blob is in is Bob's <strong>esophagus</strong> and the magical
						blob is now called a <strong>bolus</strong>, but we'll call it a <em>magical</em> bolus. Bob's esophagus uses muscles to move the magical bolus down in a process
						called <strong>peristalsis</strong>. Oh, and the magical bolus has to first pass through Bob's <strong>pharynx</strong> before entering the esophagus. The pharynx
						stops food from entering Bob's trachea (a.k.a. his windpipe).</p>

						<h2>Stomach</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The magical bolus is now inside Bob's stomach which it entered from his esophagus through the <strong>cardiac sphincter</strong> and is now called <strong>chyme</strong>
						, but we'll call it <em>magical</em> chyme. The yellow-ish liquid you see the magical chyme floating on is a mixture of various substances, one of which is <strong>hydrochloric acid</strong> that is produced by <strong>pepsin</strong> in his stomach. These digestive juices break down the magical chyme using <strong>chemical digestion</strong>. Lucky for Bob, the inside of his stomach is covered in a layer of <strong>mucus</strong>, preventing the digestive juices from damaging his stomach. Ignore all of the other things you see for now, we'll explain them in a second.</p>

						<h2>Accessory Organs</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Accessory organs are organs which the magical chyme doesn't actually pass through, but instead they help out other organs with the digestion.The magical
						chyme leaves the stomach through the <strong>pyloric sphincter</strong> on the bottom and heads towards the intestines. But first, the magical chyme is soaked with a substance called
						<strong>bile</strong> which is created by the <strong>liver</strong>, the large red organ. The bile is stored in the <strong>gallbladder</strong> which is that green sac you see.
						<br/><br/>Additionally, the curly purple-coloured organ you see is Bob's <strong>pancreas</strong>. The pancreas is very important since it releases quite a few substances. <strong>Bicarbonate</strong> is released in order to <em>neutralize</em> the acid from the stomach; <strong>trypsin</strong> is released in order to break down proteins into peptides; <strong>pancreatic amylase</strong> is released in order to break down carbohydrates into a sugar called <strong>maltose</strong>; and <strong>lipase</strong> is released in order to break down lipids (a.k.a. fats) into smaller pieces.

		<!-- Small Intestine -->
			<section id="small-intestine" class="main style2 left dark fullscreen">
				<div class="content box style2">

						<h2>Small Intestine & Celiac Disease</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The magical chyme is now in Bob's <strong>small intestine</strong> which is the tangled blue tube you see. Fun fact: Bob's small intestine is about 7 metres long meaning it would probably be taller than your house if it was stretched out. Anyways, once the magical chyme is in there, the peptides broken down earlier from the proteins by the pancreas get broken down further into amino acids by <strong>peptidases</strong>. The maltose broken down earlier is now also broken down further into glucose by <strong>maltase</strong>. The inside walls of
						the small intestine are covered in little hairs called <strong>villi</strong> shown in the first close-up. Bob's villi are covered in even smaller hairs called
						<strong>microvilli</strong>, shown in the second close-up, which is where all of the nutrients are absorbed into Bob's body. The microvilli also contain <strong>lacteals</strong> which absorb things like fats.
						<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Bob has <strong>Celiac Disease</strong>. This means that the inner walls of Bob's small intestine have been damaged by something called <em>gluten</em>
						which is a glue-like substance found in foods like bread. This causes Bob's intestines to absorb less of the nutrients in his food which can cause symptoms such as <em>anemia, diarrhea, weight loss, tiredness, cramps, bloating, and being angrier than usual</em>. There's no cure for the disease, so people like Bob have to eat gluten-free foods to prevent any
						further damage to their small intestine. We like Bob, so the magical blob of food we gave him was gluten-free.

			<section id="large-intestine" class="main style2 right dark fullscreen">
				<div class="content box style2">
					<header>
						<h2>Large Intestine</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The orange tube that the magical chyme is now inside is Bob's <strong>large intestine</strong>. Some extra nutrients left over from the small intestine are absorbed in here. Also, any
						water that the magical chyme contains is absorbed here and added to Bob's body, making the magical chyme much harder than it was before. The large intestine is much shorter than the small intestine and so it spends less time in here. When magical chyme gets to the end of the tube, Bob feels the need to get to the bathroom. In a bathroom or not, the magical chyme leaves Bob's body through the orange tube at the bottom called the <strong>rectum</strong>.

					<p id="intro-text">Now that Bob has taken what he needs from the magical blob, it has left his body.<br/>
						Unfortunately for Bob, he wasn't able to find a bathroom in time.<br/>
						We decided not to show you what happened, but you can probably figure it out yourself.</p>
